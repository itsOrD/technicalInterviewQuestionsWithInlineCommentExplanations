# technicalInterviewQuestionsWithInlineCommentExplanations

Repo for interesting technical interview questions that require a touch of explanation.

Organized into three branches:
 - `main` <-- just the question prompt
 - `spoilers` <-- question, answer, and promised inline comment explanations
 - `scratch`  &nbsp;&nbsp;<-- a madman's scribbles (aka underConstruction)
